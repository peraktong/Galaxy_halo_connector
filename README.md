# Galaxy_halo_connector
 We construct a model that can derive stellar mass from halo properties, which is trained using Hydrodynamic simulation by gradient boost algorithm. Then we apply this model to N-body simulation, which can make a mock from N-body simulation that can intimate the scatter pattern in Hydrodynamic simulation.
 Our method is a new way to connect galaxy-halo properties other than classical abundance matching.
